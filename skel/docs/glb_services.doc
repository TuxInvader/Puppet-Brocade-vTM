# GLB Service
# A global load balancing service is used by a virtual server to modify DNS
# requests in order load balance data across different GLB locations.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*basic__algorithm*]
# Defines the global load balancing algorithm to be used.
#
# [*basic__all_monitors_needed*]
# Do all monitors assigned to a location need to report success in order for
# it to be considered healthy?
#
# [*basic__autorecovery*]
# The last location to fail will be available as soon as it recovers.
#
# [*basic__chained_auto_failback*]
# Enable/Disable automatic failback mode.
#
# [*basic__chained_location_order*]
# The locations this service operates for and defines the order in which
# locations fail.
# Type:array
# Properties:
#
# [*basic__disable_on_failure*]
# Locations recovering from a failure will become disabled.
#
# [*basic__dnssec_keys*]
# A table mapping domains to the private keys that authenticate them
# Type:array
# Properties:{"domain"=>{"description"=>"A domain authenticated by the
# associated private keys.", "type"=>"string"},
# "ssl_key"=>{"description"=>"Private keys that authenticate the associated
# domain.", "type"=>"array", "uniqueItems"=>true, "items"=>{"type"=>"string"}}}
#
# [*basic__domains*]
# The domains shown here should be a list of Fully Qualified Domain Names that
# you would like to balance globally. Responses from the back end DNS servers
# for queries that do not match this list will be forwarded to the client
# unmodified. Note: "*" may be used as a wild card.
# Type:array
# Properties:
#
# [*basic__enabled*]
# Enable/Disable our response manipulation of DNS.
#
# [*basic__geo_effect*]
# How much should the locality of visitors affect the choice of location used?
# This value is a percentage, 0% means that no locality information will be
# used, and 100% means that locality will always control which location is
# used. Values between the two extremes will act accordingly.
#
# [*basic__last_resort_response*]
# The response to be sent in case there are no locations available.
# Type:array
# Properties:
#
# [*basic__location_draining*]
# This is the list of locations for which this service is draining. A location
# that is draining will never serve any of its service IP addresses for this
# domain. This can be used to take a location off-line.
# Type:array
# Properties:
#
# [*basic__location_settings*]
# Table containing location specific settings.
# Type:array
# Properties:{"location"=>{"description"=>"Location to which the associated
# settings apply.", "type"=>"string"}, "weight"=>{"description"=>"Weight for
# this location, for use by the weighted random algorithm.",
# "type"=>"integer", "minimum"=>1, "maximum"=>100, "default"=>1},
# "ips"=>{"description"=>"The IP addresses that are present in a location. If
# the Global Load Balancer decides to direct a DNS query to this location,
# then it will filter out all IPs that are not in this list.",
# "type"=>"array", "uniqueItems"=>true, "items"=>{"type"=>"string"}},
# "monitors"=>{"description"=>"The monitors that are present in a location.",
# "type"=>"array", "default"=>[], "uniqueItems"=>true,
# "items"=>{"type"=>"string"}}}
#
# [*basic__optimistic_location_health*]
# Is location health optimistic? Set true to treat a location as healthy if
# any peer reports it as healthy, set false to treat a location as failed if
# any peer reports a monitor failure.
#
# [*basic__peer_health_timeout*]
# Peer reported monitor state timeout in seconds.
#
# [*basic__return_ips_on_fail*]
# Return all or none of the IPs under complete failure.
#
# [*basic__rules*]
# Response rules to be applied in the context of the service, in order, comma
# separated.
# Type:array
# Properties:
#
# [*basic__ttl*]
# The TTL for the DNS resource records handled by the GLB service.
#
# [*log__enabled*]
# Log connections to this GLB service?
#
# [*log__filename*]
# The filename the verbose query information should be logged to. Appliances
# will ignore this.
#
# [*log__format*]
# The format of the log lines.
