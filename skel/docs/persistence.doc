# Session Persistence Class
# A session persistence class is used to identify the session a new connection
# belongs too and deliver it to the same backend node.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*basic__cookie*]
# The cookie name to use for tracking session persistence.
#
# [*basic__delete*]
# Whether or not the session should be deleted when a session failure occurs.
# (Note, setting a failure mode of 'choose a new node' implicitly deletes the
# session.)
#
# [*basic__failure_mode*]
# The action the pool should take if the session data is invalid or it cannot
# contact the node specified by the session.
#
# [*basic__note*]
# A description of the session persistence class.
#
# [*basic__subnet_prefix_length_v4*]
# When using IP-based session persistence, ensure all requests from this IPv4
# subnet, specified as a prefix length, are sent to the same node. If set to
# 0, requests from different IPv4 addresses will be load-balanced individually.
#
# [*basic__subnet_prefix_length_v6*]
# When using IP-based session persistence, ensure all requests from this IPv6
# subnet, specified as a prefix length, are sent to the same node. If set to
# 0, requests from different IPv6 addresses will be load-balanced individually.
#
# [*basic__type*]
# The type of session persistence to use.
#
# [*basic__url*]
# The redirect URL to send clients to if the session persistence is configured
# to redirect users when a node dies.
