# License
# A license key is an encoded text file that controls what functionality is
# available from each traffic manager in the cluster. Every production traffic
# manager must have a valid licence key in order to function; a traffic
# manager without a license will operate as Community Edition, which provides
# most of the functionality, but places restrictions on bandwidth and cluster
# size.
