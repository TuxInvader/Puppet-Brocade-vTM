# Admin SSL Trusted Certificate
# The "conf/ssl/admin_cas" directory contains SSL certificate authority
# certificates (CAs) and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) which can be used
# when validating connections made by the admin server for user
# authentication. CAs and CRLs can be managed under the "Catalogs > SSL >
# Admin CAs and CRLs" section of the Admin Server UI or by using functions
# under the "Catalog.SSL.AdminCertificateAuthorities" section of the SOAP API
# and CLI.
