#
# Web Accelerator Profile
# A Web Accelerator profile can be applied to an HTTP virtual server to enable
# automatic web content optimization.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*basic__background_after*]
# If Web Accelerator can finish optimizing the resource within this time limit
# then serve the optimized content to the client, otherwise complete the
# optimization in the background and return the original content to the
# client. If set to 0, Web Accelerator will always wait for the optimization
# to complete before sending a response to the client.
#
# [*basic__background_on_additional_resources*]
# If a web page contains resources that have not yet been optimized, fetch and
# optimize those resources in the background and send a partially optimized
# web page to clients until all resources on that page are ready.
#
# [*basic__config*]
# Placeholder to be overwritten when we have Web Accelerator support in RESTD
#
# [*basic__mode*]
# Set the Web Accelerator mode to turn acceleration on or off.
#
# [*basic__show_info_bar*]
# Show the Web Accelerator information bar on optimized web pages. This
# requires HTML optimization to be enabled in the acceleration settings.
