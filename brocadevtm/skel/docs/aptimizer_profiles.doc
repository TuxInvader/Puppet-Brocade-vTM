#
# Aptimizer Profile
# An Aptimizer profile can be applied to a HTTP virtual server to enable automatic web content optimization.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*basic__background_after*]
# If Aptimizer can finish optimizing the resource within this time limit then serve the optimized content to the client, otherwise complete the optimization in the background and return the original content to the client. If set to 0, Aptimizer will always wait for the optimization to complete before sending a response to the client.
#
# [*basic__background_on_additional_resources*]
# If a web page contains resources that have not yet been optimized, fetch and optimize those resources in the background and send a partially optimized web page to clients until all resources on that page are ready.
#
# [*basic__config*]
# Placeholder to be overwritten when we have Aptimizer support in RESTD
#
# [*basic__mode*]
# Set the Aptimizer mode to turn acceleration on or off.
#
# [*basic__show_info_bar*]
# Show the Aptimizer information bar on aptimized web pages. This requires HTML optimization to be enabled in the Acceleration settings.
