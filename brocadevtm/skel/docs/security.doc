# Security Settings
# Security settings that restrict remote administration for the cluster. Additional security options can be found in Global Settings.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*basic__access*]
# Access to the admin server and REST API is restricted by usernames and passwords. You can further restrict access to just trusted IP addresses, CIDR IP subnets or DNS wildcards. These access restrictions are also used when another traffic manager initially joins the cluster, after joining the cluster these restrictions are no longer used. Care must be taken when changing this setting, as it can cause the administration server to become inaccessable.</br>Access to the admin UI will not be affected until it is restarted.
