# License
# A license key is a encoded text file that controls what functionality is available from each traffic manager in the cluster. Every production traffic manager must have a valid licence key in order to function; a traffic manager without a license will operate in developer mode, allowing developers to trial a wide range of functionality, but placing restrictions on bandwidth.
