# User Group
# Permission groups specify permissions for groups of users. These groups can be given read-write or read-only access to different parts of the configuration hierarchy. Each group will contain a table of permissions. Each table entry has a name that corresponds to a part of the configuration hierarchy, and a corresponding access level. The access level may have values of either "none", "ro" (read only, this is the default), or "full".  Some permissions have sub-permissions, these are denoted by following the parent permission name with a colon (":") followed by the sub-permission name.  The built-in "admin" group has a special permission key of "all" with the value "full", this must not be altered for the "admin" group but can be used in other group configuration files to change the default permission level for the group.
