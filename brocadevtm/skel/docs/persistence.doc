# Session Persistence Class
# A session persistence class is used to identify the session a new connection belongs too and deliver it to the same backend node.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*basic__cookie*]
# The cookie name to use for tracking session persistence.
#
# [*basic__delete*]
# Whether or not the session should be deleted when a session failure occurs. (Note, setting a failure mode of 'choose a new node' implicitly deletes the session.)
#
# [*basic__failure_mode*]
# The action the pool should take if the session data is invalid or it cannot contact the node specified by the session.
#
# [*basic__note*]
# A description of the session persistence class.
#
# [*basic__type*]
# The type of session persistence to use.
#
