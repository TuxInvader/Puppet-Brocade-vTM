# Rate Shaping Class
# A rate shaping class restricts the number of connections being processed by a virtual server at once.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*basic__max_rate_per_minute*]
# Requests that are associated with this rate class will be rate-shaped to this many requests per minute, set to "0" to disable the limit.
#
# [*basic__max_rate_per_second*]
# Although requests will be rate-shaped to the "max_rate_per_minute", the traffic manager will also rate limit per-second. This smooths traffic so that a full minute's traffic will not be serviced in the first second of the minute, set this to "0" to disable the per-second limit.
